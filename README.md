Hi! My name is Jada and this is the code that I wrote for an app to democratize high school and college prep resources for students in the U.S.. I created this app primarily for the Congressional App Challenge but 
would love to take the app further. If anyone has any suggestions for the UI or things I can add please let me know, I'm always looking for ways to improve!
